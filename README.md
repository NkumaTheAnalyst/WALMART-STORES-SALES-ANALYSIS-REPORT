**2. Key Metrics**  
Total Sales: $6.74 billion  
Total Fuel Price Points Recorded: 21.61K  
Total Number of Stores: 148  

**3. Dashboard Insights**  
a. Sales Trends Over Time  
Walmart's weekly sales peaked at $81M on December 24, 2010, indicating strong holiday performance.  
A general downward trend in weekly sales is observed from December 2010 to May 2011.  
Sales stabilized at around $50M towards mid-2011.  

**b. Holiday vs. Non-Holiday Sales**  
Holiday sales: $1.04M (48.11%)  
Non-holiday sales: $1.12M (51.89%)  
Although holidays boost sales, non-holiday weeks still slightly outperform holidays, possibly due to consistent customer flow.  
  
**c. Fuel Price and Sales Correlation**    
The Total Sales vs. Fuel Price chart shows a fluctuating inverse relationship.  
When fuel prices peaked (~$180), sales saw a decline.  
This implies that rising fuel costs might reduce customer spending or affect supply chain efficiency.  
  
**d. CPI Trends**  
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) remains relatively stable, fluctuating slightly between 7900–7950 over time.  
No direct pattern is observed between CPI changes and weekly sales in this dataset.  
  
**e. Store-Level Sales Performance**
Store-level comparison reveals significant variance in performance.  
A few stores reach up to $0.3B in weekly sales.  
Several others perform significantly lower, suggesting possible operational, demographic, or regional factors influencing store output.  

**f. Unemployment Impact**
Sales are generally stronger when unemployment is below 7%.  
As unemployment rises, there is a gradual decline in weekly sales, which aligns with reduced consumer spending during economic hardship.  

**g. Temperature and Sales Correlation**
The Sales vs. Temperature scatterplot indicates:  
Sales are highest in moderate temperatures (40–70°F).  
Extreme cold or heat (0–30°F or above 85°F) sees a drop in total weekly sales, likely due to reduced shopping frequency.  
  
**4. Recommendations**  
Capitalize on Holiday Peaks  
Enhance marketing campaigns and promotions in the 2–3 weeks leading up to major holidays, especially around Christmas and New Year.  
  
Optimize Underperforming Stores  
Investigate low-performing stores for factors such as poor location, insufficient inventory, or low customer engagement.  
Implement store-specific improvement strategies based on successful store models.  

Monitor Fuel Price Trends
Since rising fuel prices potentially reduce sales, anticipate downturns by preparing logistics and offering discounts on essential items when fuel costs surge.

Tailor Sales Strategies to Temperature Patterns  
Stock and promote weather-relevant items depending on forecasted temperatures.  
Consider online promotions during extreme weather to offset reduced in-store visits.  

Economic Sensitivity Planning  
Create affordable bundles and savings campaigns during periods of high unemployment.  
Focus on essentials and price-sensitive goods in affected regions.  
  
Data-Driven Resource Allocation  
Allocate marketing budgets, manpower, and inventory more efficiently by focusing on high-performing stores and high-sales periods.  
  
# 5. Conclusion  
This Walmart sales analysis dashboard uncovers key insights about how time, external conditions, and store differences influence sales patterns. With a total of $6.74 billion in sales, Walmart maintains a solid retail presence. However, nuanced understanding of factors like holidays, temperature, fuel costs, and unemployment can enhance performance further.  
  
By taking proactive steps such as boosting holiday readiness, monitoring economic indicators, and addressing store-level disparities, Walmart can solidify its dominance while optimizing profitability and customer satisfaction.
